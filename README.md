# Constructing Smallworld Networks from word2vec vectors

Setup Instructions:

1. Download googlenews pre-trained vectors, unzip it and place it within a 'data/' folder in this project
2. Make sure you have python3.7 64bit installed and have it in your PATH
3. Run `sh setup.sh` bash script from an admin console

A `smallworld_network.json` file will be generated which contains our graph information.
